    <string name="description1">Ingredients:
        1 kg chicken (cut into serving pieces) or pork belly (cut into cubes)
        1/2 cup soy sauce
        1/2 cup vinegar (cane or coconut vinegar works well)
        1 head garlic (minced)
        1 onion (sliced)
        3-4 pieces dried bay leaves
        1 teaspoon whole peppercorns
        1 cup water
        2 tablespoons cooking oil
        Salt (to taste)
        Sugar (optional, to balance the flavors)
        Instructions:
        In a bowl, marinate the chicken or pork in soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, and peppercorns for at least 30 minutes (overnight marination is even better for deeper flavors).
        Heat the cooking oil in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the marinated meat (reserve the marinade) and brown it on all sides.
        Add the sliced onion and saut√© until translucent.
        Pour in the marinade and add the dried bay leaves. Bring to a boil.
        Once boiling, lower the heat, cover the pan, and let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the meat is tender. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
        Add water if needed, depending on how much sauce you want.
        Season with salt to taste. If the sauce is too tangy for your liking, you can add a bit of sugar to balance the flavors.
        Serve hot with steamed rice.
